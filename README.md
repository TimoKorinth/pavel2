# Pavel²
## Intuitive Visualization of high-dimensional data
Pavel² is a complete new designed Version of the Pavel Project (http://code.google.com/p/pavel/) and is a tool for interactively displaying and evaluating large sets of highdimensional data. The key task for Pavel² is the intuitive and easy Interaction with the program in combination with a rich User Interface based on the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).

The first project was developed as a student research project at Dortmund University since in October 2006. When the project was nearing its end a year later, the software was usable but still left room for improvement. Especially the usability and navigation wasn't as good as it should be.

## Features:
- Easy Import of CSV-Data
- Show your data in various visualizations
- High performance and fast navigation of huge data-sets
- Intuitive and easy Interaction
- Rich WPF User Interface
